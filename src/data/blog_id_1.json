                "value":"Our interaction with Dr. Athan has been invaluable.  My 16 yr old daughter wanted to explore engineering and Dr Athan shared his time teaching engineering concepts and prepping her for a potential internship.  His methods instilled confidence and understanding, as she grasped ideas that would have taken much longer in a normal classroom setting.  He was also able to secure a summer internship in development at Harvest Croo.  He prepared her for the internship and stayed in communication throughout the summer.  Thank you Dr Athan, as meeting and spending time with you has truly impacted her life.  It was a real turning point for her to realize, understand and gain confidence in her potential.  She is now more determined than ever to succeed and study engineering at the next level.  We will always be grateful for your support and caring.",

Dr. Athan took significant time to explain the course, he peaked our interest even more and we had no doubts that we had to try it. Our son attended a one week workshop and we honestly have to say that Dr. Athan exceeded our expectations beyond belief!  His content is high level, comprehensive, and the most in-depth course we've experienced yet! Dr. Athan was extremely attentive, boosted morale, and answered questions as if each child was in a one-on-one course. The kids were so engaged that they opted for no break on their first day! The content for this course is like no other that we've found in what's offered prior to college. We highly recommend Dr. Athan's classes and we will definitely be continuing this amazing journey with him.",

After much searching, we found Engineering Minds online.  After speaking with Dr. Athan and getting a sense of his passion for the program, we enrolled our son in the two week camp. After the first day, we knew something special was taking place. Our son couldn't stop talking about the class. His enthusiasm peaked the interest of his younger brother to the point where we had no choice but to enroll him in the camp as well.Our sons were truly excited about the program and Dr. Athan's teaching style.  They learned a tremendous amount during those two weeks and also enjoyed the interaction with their peers. We were impressed that our sons were taught engineering concepts at the collegiate level. Dr. Athan has a gift for communicating with children and keeps their interest. We are very grateful to him for his passion and commitment to getting the most out of these young minds. The program exceeded our every expectation and we look forward to many more camps in coming years and hopefully, in the near future, a camp closer to home in Fort Lauderdale.",

Engineering Minds and Dr. Athan were the perfect match! My son mastered college level concepts and explored new interests. He liked it so much that he asked to return the following summer for continued learning. He was taught marketable skills and introduced to new areas. I was astounded that a teenager was actually willing to rise early for a month in the summer and attend class. He looked forward to every session.

The material Dr. Athan included gave my son (13) and his curious mind access to advanced concepts and cutting-edge technology that has not been available or appealing to him ... and my son eagerly learned it. It didn't feel like school to him: it felt like a compelling exploration and hands-on challenge. My normally reticent son was intrigued -- and motivated. He especially enjoyed the relaxed freedom in the room, best symbolized by rubber bands and Dr. Athan's RAD Climber invention. It helps me to know what lights my son up, and how to guide him in his further education. I am especially grateful for the guidance and feedback from Dr. Athan, who took time to speak with me at length by phone before and throughout the session, to discuss in depth my son's natural talents and progress. Besides his lofty qualifications, he has a rare passion and availability for mentoring the next generation, with the perfect blend of insight, flexibility, knowledge, resources, and energy.

He was instrumental in helping me and my team with our senior project. More importantly however, he helped prepare me to begin a great career. Based on my background and capabilities, he recommended that I pursue an opportunity with a company called Schlumberger. Schlumberger is a $19B dollar leading oilfield services provider that is considered one of the top 10 run companies in the world. They have a history of only recruiting the top people from the most prestigious universities. Although the University of South Florida does not fall into that category, he and I were able to craft a plan to get an interview with them. After researching their interview schedule, I discovered that they would be interviewing at the University of Florida. Professor Athan and I then worked together to prepare for the opportunity. The strategy was to drive down the night before and attend their informal question and answer session so I could persuade them to grant me an interview. Our preparation enabled me to differentiate myself during the session and enabled me to persuade them to create an interview slot at the end of the day. In the interview I was able to impress both of their recruiters so they extended an offer to interview at their North American Headquarters in Houston. Professor Athan and I then prepared for the final interview. I flew to Houston and interviewed for two days with many leaders from their organization. Our preparation enabled me to receive a great offer that I subsequently accepted.<br><br>Without Professor Athanâ€™s help, I would never have had the opportunity to work for one of the top 10 best run companies in the world.

He continually provided both positive and negative feedback, helping to focus our sonâ€™s efforts. Throughout each session, he maintained a level of humor, intensity, and contagious enthusiasm which made the work enjoyable.

My personalized boot camp covered not just engineering, but business, etiquette, logistics, contracts, intellectual property, and the value of continued academics. As a direct result of working with Dr. Athan my first job out of college was Radiation Effects Analysis Engineer with NASA at Goddard Space Flight Center, Maryland. My second and current job is obtaining my PhD from Cornell, one of the 8 Ivy League Universities. Working with Dr. Athan was an incredible experience and I thank him for his unwavering commitment, patience, and guidance.",
